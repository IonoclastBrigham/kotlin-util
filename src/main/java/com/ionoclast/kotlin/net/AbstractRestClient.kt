/**
 * *Abstract base class for Android REST API clients in Kotlin 1.1+.*
 *
 * To implement an API client using this class, create your endpoint interfaces as usual,
 * and wrap them in suspending functions that call `makeRequest(Job, Call<T>)`.
 *
 * To use these APIs, create a coroutine block that will continue on the UI thread, such
 * as by using the supplied `networkTask()` function. If you need to make sequential
 * calls, such as pulling a list of IDs and querying one or more with a second call, or
 * prefetching a token to use with another call, you can do that within the coroutine
 * block; the will be executed in order, with results returned on the UI thread as if
 * it were all synchronously executed. If you want multiple concurrent calls, they
 * can be spawned from within multiple coroutine blocks.
 *
 * You should pre-allocate a Job instance for your Fragment or Activity, and pass that
 * to your API calls, so they can all be cancelled appropriately with the Android app
 * lifecycle, on user request, after a timeout, etc.
